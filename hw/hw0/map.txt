Use objdump with the -D flag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output of running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?
The address of main, recur and static data stuff. The address of main, recur are in .text, the address of static data stuff is in .data.

Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the Internet if you donâ€™t know).
.text is an ipmortant segment (it stores all the code.)
.data and .bss are important segments (they stores all the staticly allocated variable)
